# babel-boilerplate
There's no reason not to be using Babel in 2018. Now it's easier to setup than ever before!

## First clone the repository with this command:
`git clone https://github.com/addisonday/babel-boilerplate.git .`

## Then make the script executable by running:
`chmod +x babel-boilerplate-new.sh`

## Finally, run the script:
`./babel-boilerplate-new.sh`

Watch the magic right before your eyes!
The script will create a directory with the following structure:
```
  -babel-setup
  | |
  | |
  | |- src
  |
  |- README.md
  |-.babelrc
  |- package.json
```
